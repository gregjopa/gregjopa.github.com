<BioWithPhoto>

I'm a software engineer living in Chicago working for [cars.com](https://www.cars.com/).

Over the past decade I've focused on building web applications. I've worked for companies
ranging from startups to large dot-coms ([yellowpages.com](https://www.yellowpages.com/) and [cars.com](https://www.cars.com/)).
With every project I work on, I'm a voice for the user and enjoy discovering new ways to optimize the user experience.

I'm passionate about teaching and enjoy presenting at meetups. I'm a member of the
[Toastmasters International](https://www.toastmasters.org/) club where we
meet regularly to practice public speaking and develop our communication skills.

Music has always been a big part of my life. I play guitar and drums and incorporate music into most of my blog posts.
I'm a Christian and love playing guitar and drums in the [Four Corners Community Church](https://fccc.church/) worship band.

I'm blessed with an amazing family. Here's my wife Raquel and my two kids, Micah and Delilah.
